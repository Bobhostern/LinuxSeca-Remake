Welcome to LinuxSeca Remake!

I decided the last LinuxSeca was not that featureful, so I rewrote LinuxSeca from the bottom up, and this is the product.
New features include:
	- A YAML based format for storing questions and answers (.lsybin format)
	- A merged question and correct answer file format
	- Data dumping (Just For Fun feature)
	- Previous session loading support (through data dumping)
	- Result file template support
	- XML file format for easy conversion to .lsybin format using the CreateQDataFromXML QDataNGUIGen program
	- Userdata file for multiple users on the same program
	- And many more to come!

Thank you for staying with LinuxSeca!

BTW: To start LinuxSeca, create a userdata.lsy file in this directory, then take a look at README.userdata for a (kinda) tutorial.
You can find the CreateQDataFromXML QDataNGUIGen program code at https://github.com/Bobhostern/CreateLSRQDataFromXML.
